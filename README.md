# Mini-exercise #

This mini-exercise is worth 1% of your final grade.   
You can think of it as a "free mark for setting up your work environment".

## Step 1 ##
### Due Friday, Sep 12, at 7 p.m.  ###

 1. Sign up for a (free) GitHub account on http://github.com.   
   You will be using your GitHub account to submit most (if not all) of the work for this course.
 2. We will need to match your GitHub username with your CDF username. In order to do that:
   * Open this [shared document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cfMUq0NngeipZlkQKFZHZBXILL-s-dftio2MizPrJ_4/edit?usp=sharing).
   * Enter your GitHub username next to you CDF username.   
      * Each line in the doc should be of the format `cdfUsername,gitHubUsername`   
      * If you can't find your CDF username in the doc, just add it at the end of the list.


After the due date for this step, your instructor will create a *personal repository* on GitHub for each student. You will use your personal repository to complete step 2 of this mini-exercise. 

Please note that:
 * Your personal repository is private, and is only accessible to you, the TA's and instructors of the course.
 * Your personal repository will have the same name as your CDF username.
 * You will use your personal repository throughout the term to submit your individual work.


## Step 2 ##
### Due Monday, Sep 15, at 1 p.m. ###

Your personal repository contains a folder called `mini-exercise` containing a file called `mark.txt`.
If you look at the content of this file, you will see that it simply contains the digit `0`.

You task is to "change your mark" from `0` to `1`.
 1. Clone your personal repository to your local computer.
 2. Edit `mini-exercise/mark.txt`, and change the `0` to `1`.
 3. Commit your changes, and push them to your personal repository on GitHub.

### Verify that you have completed your task ###

 1. Open you browser.
 2. Go to http://github.com, and log in (if you are not already logged in).
 3. Look at the content of `mini-exercise/mark.txt` in your personal repository. Is it `1`? Great job, you're done!
